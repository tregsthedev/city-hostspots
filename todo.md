# Things to do
- Figure out why the hotspots won't render on the list
- Get the wifi icon working on the thing
- Do we still want to figure out how to implement distance?
- Make button work instead of asking for the popup right away
- rewrite the code & figure out why it isn't working (You can do this! It is very important)
